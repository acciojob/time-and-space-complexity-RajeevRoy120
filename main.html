	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. It helps in analyzing how efficient an algorithm is when processing large inputs.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires in terms of input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to denote how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
